## Argo Events | Kubernetes ☸️
Argo Events is an event-driven workflow automation framework for Kubernetes which helps you trigger K8s objects, Argo Workflows, Serverless workloads, etc. on events from a variety of sources like webhooks, S3, schedules, messaging queues, gcp pubsub, sns, sqs, etc.


🧱 Core Components
```
✅ EventSource ( Defines an external system to listen to GitHub Webhook, S3, Kafka, Cron, etc.)
✅ Sensor ( Defines what to do when an event is received Trigger a Workflow or Job )
✅ EventBus ( Provides pub/sub message delivery internally between EventSources and Sensors e.g. NATS )

```
